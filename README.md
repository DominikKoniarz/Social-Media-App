# Social Media App

Social media application created using React, Express and Socket.io (typescript).

# Overwiew

This project is a full-stack application which is imitating social media application. Built using TypeScript, React, Express and Prisma.<br/>
Created in colaboration with [@Vocyl](https://github.com/Vocyl).<br/>
This app could be improved in few places by using some good practices like code splitting and better management of files.<br/>
A huge point is that this app is not taking an advantage of some crucial patterns like server side rendering. Because of that it could be beneficial for this case to use for example NextJS.<br/>
This was caused by not enough knowledge of this framework at the time when we started creating this project, so we used React for frontend and Express for backend (with no ssr included).

# Tasks distribution

Most of the backend and overall project architecture was done by me ([@DominikKoniarz](https://github.com/DominikKoniarz)).
Frontend belonged to my teammate [@Vocyl](https://github.com/Vocyl) who ensured that everything lined up with UI design and substitued his own ideas in places where design was not specified.
